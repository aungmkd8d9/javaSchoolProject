Food Ordering System project developed with java


Hello I'm Aung Myo Khant, second year computer science student.

This is the project I made since I was at first year. I've learned about creating functions and methods at that time. So I created this project by utilizing those techniques. I think this project may only cover beginner level. So if u are CS student like me, you are free to use and view my poor code haha.
